# Week 11

## Application Example: Photo OCR
Congratulations on making it to the eleventh and final week! This week, we will walk you through a complex, end-to-end application of machine learning, to the application of Photo OCR. Identifying and recognizing objects, words, and digits in an image is a challenging task. We discuss how a pipeline can be built to tackle this problem and how to analyze and improve the performance of such a system.

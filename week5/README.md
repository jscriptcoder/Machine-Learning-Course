# Week 5

## Neural Networks: Learning
In Week 5, you will be learning how to train Neural Networks. The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms (when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what I usually turn to), and this week's videos explain the 'backpropagation' algorithm for training these models. In this week's programming assignment, you'll also get to implement this algorithm and see it work for yourself.

The Neural Network programming exercise will be one of the more challenging ones of this class. So please start early and do leave extra time to get it done, and I hope you'll stick with it until you get it to work! As always, if you get stuck on the quiz and programming assignment, you should post on the Discussions to ask for help. (And if you finish early, I hope you'll go there to help your fellow classmates as well.)
